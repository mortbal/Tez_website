# Getting Started with Unreal Engine 5

Welcome to the exciting world of **Unreal Engine 5** development! This guide will walk you through the essential concepts you need to know.

## What You'll Learn

- Basic UE5 concepts and terminology
- Setting up your first project
- Understanding Blueprints vs C++
- Essential workflows for game development

## Key Features of UE5

UE5 introduces several groundbreaking features:

1. **Nanite Geometry** - Revolutionary virtualized geometry system
2. **Lumen** - Dynamic global illumination solution  
3. **World Partition** - Better handling of large worlds
4. **Chaos Physics** - Advanced destruction and simulation

### Code Example

Here's a simple Blueprint node setup for player movement:

```cpp
// Basic C++ movement component
void AMyPawn::SetupPlayerInputComponent(UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)
{
    Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);
    
    // Bind movement functions
    PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis("MoveForward", this, &AMyPawn::MoveForward);
    PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis("MoveRight", this, &AMyPawn::MoveRight);
}
```

> **Pro Tip:** Always start with Blueprints for prototyping, then optimize critical systems in C++ for better performance.
